# ForkBomb
# Fork Bomb Batch Script

This repository contains a batch script that creates a fork bomb when executed. A fork bomb is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack against a computer system. It works by continuously creating new processes to exhaust the system's resources, causing the system to slow down or even crash.

## WARNING

**DO NOT run this script unless you fully understand what a fork bomb is and the potential impact it can have on your system. Running this script may cause your system to become unresponsive and may require a restart to recover.**

## Script Details

The script prompts the user for input before starting the fork bomb. If the user enters "yes", the fork bomb starts. If the user enters "no", the script exits without starting the fork bomb. If the user enters anything else, the script prompts the user to enter their choice again.

## Stopping the Fork Bomb

If you run the fork bomb, you can stop it by closing the Command Prompt window or using the Task Manager to end the process.
